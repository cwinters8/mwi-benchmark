Message:
Hello,

My team and I are working on [insert project description] for your company. In order to move forward with the project, we need credentials and server information to access the source code for your application. Please provide an IP address, username, and password that can be used to access the source code. You can send us the information by encrypted email or through a shared credential in a password management system such as LastPass. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this request.

Thank you,
Clark Winters

## Code Test

One thing I don't feel great about with this is that I didn't know what sans-serif font was used in the mockup image. I decided to let the font family be Arial for the purposes of this exercise. I imagine that in real life, a designer would have provided the correct font family to use.

You can also run the project locally:

```sh
cd code-test
npm install
npm start
```

To run tests:

```sh
npm test
```
